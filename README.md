AI Black & White Image Colorization

This project is a black-and-white image colorization tool using OpenCV and Deep Learning. It utilizes a pre-trained Caffe model to colorize grayscale images automatically.

ðŸš€ Features

Upload a black-and-white image, and the model will colorize it.

Uses Deep Learning with a pre-trained Caffe model.

Streamlit-based UI for easy interaction.

Error handling for missing files or incorrect formats.

ðŸ“Œ Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/vishaljain147/image-colorization.git

cd your-repo

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Download Pre-trained Model Files:

Download the required model files:

models_colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt

colorization_release_v2.caffemodel

pts_in_hull.npy

Place them inside the models/ directory.

ðŸŽ® Usage

Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py

ðŸŽ¨ How It Works

Upload a black-and-white image using the UI.

The deep learning model processes the image.

The colorized image is displayed next to the original.

ðŸ“· Example

Original	Colorized

ðŸ›  Dependencies

Python 3.x

OpenCV

NumPy

Streamlit

PIL

Install all dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

âš  Troubleshooting

Model files not found? Ensure they are correctly placed in the models/ directory.
